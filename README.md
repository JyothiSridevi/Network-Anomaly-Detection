# Network-Anomaly-Detection
The primary goal of the network anomaly detection system is to develop a robust solution that can identify deviations from normal traffic behavior, flagging any unusual or potentially harmful activities. By analyzing these anomalies, the system facilitates proactive responses to security threats, thereby enhancing overall network security.
The system leverages machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis to differentiate between normal and anomalous network behavior.
Machine Learning: Algorithms such as k-means clustering, support vector machines (SVM), or autoencoders are used to learn the typical patterns of network traffic. Unusual traffic patterns are flagged as anomalies.
The project was implemented in Google Colab, where Jupyter notebooks were used for code execution, data visualization, and generating reports.
The system provides a graphical representation of network traffic, showcasing insights like normal versus anomalous patterns, frequency of anomalies, and locations of detected threats.
Application : This system is applicable in detecting network attacks such as DDoS, port scanning, and data exfiltration.
This network anomaly detection project showcases a combination of machine learning, network analysis, and security, making it a valuable asset for addressing cybersecurity challenges.
